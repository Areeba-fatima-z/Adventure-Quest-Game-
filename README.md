# Adventure-Quest-Game-

A simple console-based adventure game implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project was created as part of a university assignment for the **CS1004 - Object Oriented Programming** course.

##  Project Structure

Only one `.cpp` file is uploaded in this repository which contains the complete logic of the game. The Visual Studio solution (`.sln`) file and project files are not included.

## Features

- Console-based player vs player adventure game
- Grid-based board navigation
- Obstacles and helper objects (e.g., fire, snake, sword, shield, water, key)
- Turn-based player movement
- Win/loss logic
- Object-oriented design using classes and encapsulation

##  Getting Started

To run the game, simply:

1. Open the `.cpp` file in your C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Code::Blocks).
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to play the game.

> Note: The code uses standard C++ libraries and runs in a console environment. No external dependencies are required.
